INTRODUCTION
============

im4java is a pure-java interface to the ImageMagick
commandline. It is not meant as a replacement for JMagick, but as an addition.

This repo is a fork from the official im4java repo.

INSTALL
=======

To install as a maven package: make install (need to have maven installed in the OS)

Make sure to label the version differently than the package in maven central
and modify the install target in Makefile

Example pom.xml dependency:
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.im4java</groupId>
    <artifactId>im4java</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.1</version>
</dependency>

LICENSE
=======

im4java is licensed under the LGPL (see file COPYING.LIB). Since
im4java is a wrapper libary, you should also make sure that you comply
to the individual license-statements of all the tools you use
indirectly through im4java.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

All documentation is now available in HTML and PDF. Point your browser
to doc/index.html. The documentation in the downloaded package usually
is a copy of the documentation available on the im4java-website.

Note that the source-distribution only contains the source for the
documentation (in doc-src/xdocs).

FEEDBACK
========

Any feedback (bug-reports, suggestions, criticism) is welcome.
Currently, JMagick and im4java share a single mailing-list. You should
register to the jmagick-users mailing-list at jmagick.sourceforge.net.
